# Job Preparation

In this sprint, you will be working on an existing project that has already had several sprints worth of work put into it by another development team.

There are still outstanding bugs that need to be fixed, features that need to be added, and tests to be written for the API endpoints. Your team's job will be the following two tasks.

1. Build the remaining Python code, and React client, to complete implemention of the features.
1. Fix any errors and failing tests that are currently existing.

## Requirements

A pull request template is provided in the API code you will be using. This is the company template. Please do not modify it or remove it. Make sure each PR is documented to the best of your ability. Poor PRs will be rejected.
