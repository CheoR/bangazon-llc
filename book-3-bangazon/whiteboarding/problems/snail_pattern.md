# Snail's Path

Write a function that takes one parameter. The parameter will be a list of lists. Return the elements of the array arranged from outermost elements to the middle element, traveling clockwise. Take a look at the example images for a visual.

## Examples
```py
list_example = [[1,2,3],
         [4,5,6],
         [7,8,9]]
snail(list_example) # returns [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]
```

### Need a hint?
The length of each inner list will always match the length of the outer list

### Finished?
Can you find another solution?
