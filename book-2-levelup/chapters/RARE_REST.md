# Build Rare Professionally

In these two sprints, you are going to be working as a professional development team in a larger organization - an organization with a database management team, and a product development team.

Below, there are two links that you will use as reference for implementing this application.

## Setup

Since you already have a `client` and a `server` directory for Rare from the first group project, it is recommended that everyone make an additional `api` directory as a sibling to the other two. This directory will be the home for your Django project.

**One teammate** should follow these steps and create a new repository in your cohort's organization. Make sure you follow the naming schema of your React client repo.

For example, if your initial repo is named `Rare-Goofy-Gophers`, your new repo should be named `Rare-API-Goofy-Gophers`.

Then open the [Level Up API Setup](https://github.com/nashville-software-school/bangazon-llc/blob/full-stack-python/book-2-levelup/chapters/DRF_INSTALLS.md) chapter and follow those steps. Make sure you do not use `levelup` for the project or application name. Use the following names instead.

### Creating the Project

```sh
django-admin startproject rare
```

### Creating the API Application

```sh
python manage.py startapp rareapi
```
