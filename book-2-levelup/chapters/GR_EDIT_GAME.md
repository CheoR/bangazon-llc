# Editing Game Details

Only the user who created the game should be allowed to edit its details. Again, those details are...

* Title
* Description
* Designer
* Year released
* Number of players
* Estimated time to play
* Age recommendation

Refactor the **`GameForm`** component you made to create games to also edit an existing game. That means its time to pull out the `handleControlledInputChange()` function again.
