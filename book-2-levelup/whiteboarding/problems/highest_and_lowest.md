### Highest and Lowest
Write a function that takes a string of comma separated numbers and returns the highest and lowest number as a dictionary

## Examples

```py
high_and_low("4, 7, 55555, -29834, 89")
# Returns
{
    'highest': 55555,
    'lowest': -29834
}
```





### Need a hint?
Look up how to use the `max` and `min` functions in python
### Finished?
Try writing your own `min` and `max` functions instead of using the built-in functions
