### Add Multiples of 3 and/or 5
Write a function that that takes a positive integer as a parameter. 
The function should return the sum of all the multiples of 3 and/or 5 less than (but not equal to) the number passed in


## Example
```py
solution(10) 
# returns 23
# 3 + 5 + 6 + 9
```



### Need a hint?
You'll need to create an iterable (something that can be looped over ie. `List`) of the numbers below the parameter. Look up the `range` function and `modulo` operator
### Finished?
Refactor to use a list comprehension
