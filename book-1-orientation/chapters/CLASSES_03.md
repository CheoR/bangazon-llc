<!-- An animal can also _do stuff_, or we can interact with that animal. You can read a book. You can put a bookmark it in to save your spot as you read it. -->

<!-- Now let's do something with the book. You will start and stop reading the book.

```py
mockingbird = Book()
mockingbird.title = "To Kill a Mockingbird"
mockingbird.publisher = "Penguin Books"
mockingbird.author = "Harper Lee"
mockingbird.year_published = 1960
mockingbird.publisher = "J. B. Lippincott & Co."


print(mockingbird.currently_reading)
mockingbird.start_reading()
print(mockingbird.currently_reading)
mockingbird.stop_reading(34)
mockingbird.start_reading()
mockingbird.stop_reading(89)
mockingbird.start_reading()
```

When you run that code, it produces the output.

```py
False
You start reading To Kill a Mockingbird at page 1
True
You start reading To Kill a Mockingbird at page 34
You start reading To Kill a Mockingbird at page 89
