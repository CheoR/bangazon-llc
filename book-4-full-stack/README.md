# Book 4 - Django Web APIs

This book shows you how to use the Django REST Framework to expose an API for application development. In this application, customers are going to build an itinerary of attractions that they want to visit at Kennywood. Each attraction is assgined to a specific area of the park, and each area has a particular theme.
